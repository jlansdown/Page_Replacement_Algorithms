This program implements page replacement algorithms:
First-in-first-out
Least recently used
Optimal

.txt file 1 through 4 are the base cases
using 3, 4, 5 and 6 frames with the same
reference string.

5.txt is updated with a random reference
string for the 50 trial averages.

There is no input validation implemented
in this program, so please be careful
when prompted for user input.
